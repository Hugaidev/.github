# Welcome to HUG AI 👋

**Human-Governed AI for Real-World Software.**

At HUG AI, we believe in building AI-powered software **with structure, ethics, and human oversight**. We help organizations move faster without losing control — combining intelligent agents, explainable tooling, and a robust methodology that puts people at the center.

This `.github` repository is our public handshake: it contains the shared principles, workflows, and community standards that power every repo in the org.

## 🌍 What We Stand For

- **Governed AI Development**: Every AI output is auditable, reversible, and approved by humans.
- **Open Methodology**: Our [HUG AI Development Lifecycle](https://hugai.dev/ai-development-lifecycle) is designed to scale from startups to enterprises.
- **Composable AI Agents**: Each agent does one thing well — planning, testing, documenting, and more — all orchestrated in clear pipelines.
- **Responsible Automation**: We care about security, compliance, and fairness. Model decisions are traceable and validated.

## 🛠 How We Work

Every repository under this organization follows shared governance:

- **CI/CD Pipelines** with automated tests, audits, and rollbacks
- **Issue and PR Templates** to guide structured collaboration
- **Security and Compliance Policies** aligned with GDPR, SOC2, and ethical AI guidelines
- **Human + AI Development**: Developers and agents work together across planning, coding, testing, and maintenance

## 🍿 Fun Fact

This entire methodology was sparked by a Shakira lyric:  
> *“Se me acaba el argumento y la metodología…”*

So we decided to write one — with rhythm, rigor, and governance.

## ✨ Do Mighty Things

If you believe AI should be powerful *and* principled, we’d love to collaborate.  
Build with us. Govern with us. Improve the future with us.
